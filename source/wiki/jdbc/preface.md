This document supersedes and consolidates the content of these predecessor specifications: 

■ “JDBC: A Java SQL API” 

■ “JDBC 2.1 API” 

■ “JDBC 2.0 Standard Extension API” 

■ “JDBC 3.0 Specification” 

This document introduces a range of new features for the JDBC API and is combined with various specification improvements that focus on features introduced in or before the JDBC 3.0 API. Where possible, any adjustment to the JDBC 3.0 API is marked for easy identification - look for the JDBC 4.2 API demarcation for specific features introduced in this revised and updated specification. Readers can also download the API specification (JavadocTM API and comments) for a complete and precise definition of JDBC classes and interfaces.
